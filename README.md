# Telecom
Maven Telecommunications data was gotten from Maven in a csv format, the company wants to know the reasons for their customers churn. So i used Python to clean,analyze and visualize my findings from the data. Maven telecommunications has a total of 7043 customers both stayed,churned and new members. Total revenue of the company is 21.37m and Total charges is about 16.06m. 1800+ churned customers, most of the churned customer left because of offer been given to them by maven,competitors also have better devices and some left because of their sales rep attitude. More insight are available in my analysis and i also recommend few solutions for Maven inorder to keep and maintain their customers and potential customers.
